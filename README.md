# MERN Stack Notes Webapp
a web app for users to take and organize notes
### Introduction
The MERN stack which consists of **Mongo DB**, **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **React.js** is a popular stack for building full-stack web-based applications because of its simplicity and ease of use. In recent years, with the explosive popularity and the growing maturity of the JavaScript ecosystem, the MERN stack has been the goto stack for a large number of web applications. This stack is also highly popular among newcomers to the JS field because of how easy it is to get started with this stack.
<br/><br/>
I built this repo sometime back whil learning the stack
<br/><br/>
This is a full-stack application that can be up and running with just a few steps. 
Its frontend is built with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) running on top of React.
The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js.
